## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more of flexbox and grid. I also learned how to center an element using margins.

An Example of some of my code:
```css
main {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin: auto;
  width: 100%;
}
```


### Continued development

Definently flexbox and grid, mixing the two to create stunning layouts. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Layout Generator](https://layout.bradwoods.io/) - This helped me for figuring out flexbox and grid. I really liked the way it simplifies layouts and will use it going forward.
